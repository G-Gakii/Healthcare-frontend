# Accessible Healthcare Web App

## Overview

Access to affordable healthcare remains a critical issue in many regions, particularly for individuals in low-income and underserved communities. Patients often struggle with finding nearby healthcare providers, understanding the cost of services, and scheduling appointments efficiently.
